II. Final Project

    1. Application Mockup - Final Project Mockup
         *This is created to generate view mockups for app proposal homework, not to be graded for Final Project
    
    2. Prototype Submission - I Spy
         *This is created as prototype for Final Project, however, due to the inaccuracy of the trained models, 
         *may need to lower previously estbalished expectations for this application, 
         *currently functions as a object identifying application
         
    3. Final Project IV: Completed App - I Spy (built on top of prototype)
         *This is the final submission for the final project, changed made since the prototype submission includes: 
            I.   Added NavigationView for better flow of the app; no longer sitting on home screen for all activities.
            II.  Segmented ContentView to ContentView (Navigation Control), CameraModeView (Camera-Mode specific view), 
                 PictureModeView (Picture-Mode specific view).
            III. Added animation for buttons for better user experiences in both modes. 
            IV.  Focuses more on object identification results, accents the output.
            V.   Swift Package Manager - Added a new package dependency: IrregularGradient using "import IrregularGradient".
                 (https://github.com/joogps/IrregularGradient)
            VI.  Tried switching to an alternative machine model but not receiving better results, will maintain the same model for submission.
            VII. Restructured xcode project folder, now all constant variables will be included in "Constants" folder.
